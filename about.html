  I am Senior Scientist and "Privatdozent" for Physical Geography and Hydrology at the Department of Geography, University of Zurich.
  <br>
  <br>
  My main research interest is centred on water in mountain areas, both in the Alps as well as world-wide.
  Within this topic, I try to answer questions concerning water resources, natural hazards and hydrological processes.
  Iâ€™m also particularly interested in changes in the Earth system, especially as regards climate and land use as well as demographic and socio-economic developments.

  Every now and then I like to take pictures, you will a few of them around here as well.
